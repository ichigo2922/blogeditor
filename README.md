## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/blogs` - Retrieve all blogs
- `GET /api/blogs/:id` - Retrieve a blog by ID
- `POST /api/blogs/save-draft` - Save a new draft

- `POST /api/blogs/publish` - Publish a new blog
- `POST /api/blogs/:id/publish` - Publish an existing blog

## Implementation Details

### Auto-Save Functionality

The auto-save feature is implemented using a debounce mechanism that triggers a save operation after 5 seconds of user inactivity when editing blog content. This helps to prevent data loss and provides a seamless writing experience.

### Data Storage

For simplicity, this implementation uses a file-based JSON storage system for the backend. In a production environment, you would want to replace this with a proper database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
